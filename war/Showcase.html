    <h1>Pairs Trader - VERSION 0.04f</h1>


	<h2><a href=pairstrader.jnlp>CLICK HERE to launch Pairs Trader (via Web Start / JNLP)</a></h2>

CHICAGO, IL: JTalics LLC releases Pairs Trader(TM), which is a software tool that manages pairs for 
the retail pairs trader using the Interactive Brokers environment.

If you are not familiar with pairs trading here is a good introduction link listed below.  Pairs trading is becoming very popular for today's retail investor.
However, pair trading may be tedious and error-prone for some.  Unlike options spreads, no stock exchange can *guarantee* that a combination of stocks will be transacted as a unit in an all-or-none fashion.  
Thus a trader can't tell a stock exchange to "buy this pair"; instead the trader must buy or sell each leg of the pair separately.  While this is easy for one single pair, it gets very difficult when you are buying and selling hundreds of pairs a day.  
That's where Pairs Trader(TM) comes in.  It keeps track of pairs of stocks so that execution is a simple point and click.

<h3>What's new in version 0.04 ALPHA?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Preferences are persisted.</li>Some "ergonomic" settings can be saved.  (Import/Export of user date will be implemented in a future version.) 
<li>Server simulation.</li> Instead of connecting to TWS, you can connect to a simulated server.  Any symbol that you type in will cause a Book to be created for it and a "Brownian motion" priced order placer will be started.
<li>Auto-close</li>A position is automatically closed when a stop is exceeded.
</ul>
